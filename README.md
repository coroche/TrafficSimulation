# Traffic Simulation
Exploring object oriented programming with a traffic simulator  
  
This project is in it's early stages. The aim is to be able to create a map, define roads signals, add vehicles and have them interect with traffic signals and eachother. Below we see four cars approach a stop sign. Each car stops at the junction. If the way is clear they proceed. If not they wait until it is.

Once all logic and traffic interaction is working I will turn my attention to creating less abstract renderings.
